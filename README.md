# Bubble-table

A table component for the [Bubble Tea framework](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea).

This is currently messy as it's in early development and came out of a different
project, and should be cleaned up over time.

## Features

Displays a table with a header and borders.

Can be focused to highlight a row and navigate with up/down (and j/k).

Can make rows selectable, and fetch the current selections.

## Future plans

Add pagination.

Add sorting.

Add cell selection.

Add search filters.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome, but since this is being actively developed for use in
[Khan](https://github.com/evertras/khan) please check first by opening an issue!
